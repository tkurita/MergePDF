MergePDF
========
MergePDF can merge many PDF/image files into one PDF file.

The main feature of MergePDF is that it determines the order of binding the PDF/image files according to their view sorting order in the Finder. The PDF files will merge with the order displayed.

Additionally, MergePDF can create bookmarks named according to their original file names.
